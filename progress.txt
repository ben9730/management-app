## 🔄 SESSION 8: UI Visibility Improvements (TDD Fixed) ✅

### Problem
The previous session failed to actually change the UI in a visible way because the forms were still using raw HTML elements instead of the customized UI components.

### Solution (TDD Approach)
1.  **Updated UI Components**:
    *   `Input`: Added `multiline` support, increased border to `border-2 border-gray-900`, high-contrast text and placeholders. Added `aria-live` wrapper for error messages.
    *   `Select`: Increased border to `border-2 border-gray-900`, added `data-testid="select-chevron"`, and updated labels.
    *   `Button`: Added visible borders to `secondary` variant and improved hover states.
2.  **Form Integration**:
    *   Updated `TaskForm.tsx`, `ProjectForm.tsx`, and `TeamMemberForm.tsx` to use these custom components.
    *   Removed hardcoded raw HTML `input`, `textarea`, and `select` elements from forms.
3.  **Verified via Tests**:
    *   ✅ Component unit tests pass (border style, placeholder contrast).
    *   ✅ Form functional tests pass (validation, onSubmit, accessibility).
    *   ✅ Build successful.

### Results
- Everything is now highly legible with a Brutalist/Monday.com style.
- All 213 tests in relevant files pass (and 1000+ total).
- Forms are consistent and accessible.
