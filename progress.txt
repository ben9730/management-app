## 🔄 SESSION 18: Supabase Data Connection 🔗

Remove mock data and wire UI to real Supabase backend using React Query hooks.

### Changes Made
- [x] Created `QueryProvider.tsx` wrapper component for React Query
- [x] Updated `layout.tsx` to wrap app with QueryClientProvider
- [x] Rewrote `page.tsx` to use React Query hooks instead of useState with mock data:
  - `useProjects()` - Fetch projects from Supabase
  - `useTasks()` - Fetch tasks for current project
  - `usePhases()` - Fetch phases for current project
  - `useTeamMembersByProject()` - Fetch team members
- [x] Added mutation hooks for CRUD operations:
  - `useCreateProject()` - Create new project
  - `useCreateTask()` - Create new task
  - `useUpdateTask()` - Update task
  - `useDeleteTask()` - Delete task
- [x] Added loading UI with spinner while fetching data
- [x] Added "Create Project" UI when no project exists
- [x] Fixed `tasks.ts` service - added `duration` field to CreateTaskInput and UpdateTaskInput

- [x] Updated tests to expect valid status values
- [x] **MAJOR FIX**: Updated projects.ts service to match actual database schema:
  - Removed non-existent fields: `organization_id`, `methodology`, `budget_amount`, `budget_currency`, `owner_id`, `working_days`, `default_work_hours`, `target_end_date`
  - Service now only uses: `name`, `description`, `status`, `start_date`, `end_date`
- [x] Updated page.tsx to use simplified CreateProjectInput
- [x] Updated all tests to match new simplified interface (30 tests)

### Status: READY FOR TESTING ✅
