## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Hard blocking for locked phases (not soft warnings) — user's explicit choice
- Sequential phase order only — matches existing phase_order column
- Toast notification only (no notification panel) — ephemeral is enough for v1

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- page.tsx is 1,238 lines — new UI work should extract into hooks/components, not add to it
